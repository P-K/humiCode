# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


#Populate database with Role information 
# r1 = Role.new(id: 0, name: "employee", editCompensation: false, accessRecords:false)
# r2 = Role.new(id: 1, name: "admin", editCompensation: true, accessRecords:true)
# r1.save!
# r2.save!
